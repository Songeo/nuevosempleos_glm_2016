The project intends to assess the creation 
of new jobs in Mexico. 
Through the last couple of years, the unemployment 
rate in Mexico has decreased according to official 
sources. However, in 2016 approximately 57% of the 
employed population belonged to the informal sector.


The purpose of the analysis is to model 
the formal new jobs created and assess the behavior
per economic sector.
This, to identify sectors with decreasing trends
and focus efforts to aid them.

For the project, a Poisson model with  hierarchical
specificaction was implemented with Gibbs Sampler 
JAGS and R. 

In the repository only code in R and JAGS
is uploaded. Data is omitted due to 
confidentiality.
